
WordPress Flashfader 1.0 Plugin - Instructions


  ## Installation - Usage - Uninstallation ##
 
  1. Install: Copy the 2 files flashfader.php and flashfader.swf
     in the plugins directory (wp-content/plugins). Activate the plugin.
	 Go to "Manage" in the admin panel, open submenu item "Flashfader".
	 
  2. Usage:
     If you see the settings and upload page, the installation went fine.
	 Upload 2 images for a test-drive.
	 
	 Now you need to open one of the files of your current template.
	 Assuming you use the default template (wp-content/themes/default),
	 open sidebar.php and place the following code directly under
	 <div id="sidebar">
	 
	<!-- Flashfader -->
	<?php include (ABSPATH.'wp-content/flashfader/flashfaderhtml.txt'); ?>
	<!-- /Flashfader -->
	
	Upload sidebar.php in the template's directory.
	Reload your WP homepage and you should see your slidehow.
	
	sidebar.php was just an example. You can place the code in any template file,
	just make sure it is placed in html and not within <?php ?> tags.
	
	
  3. Uninstallation:
  	
	 First remove the code that calls the flash in the template! You might get
	 an ugly error message on your page otherwise.
  
	 The plugin creates one folder (wp-content/flashfader) and some files.
	 Your images are stored in that folder as well.
	 To remove the plugin just use the uninstall button at the bottom of the admin
	 page. You could try to delete the folder via FTP, but some servers won't let 
	 you because of permission settings.
	 That's what the uninstall button is there for.
	 
	 
	 
	## Note on sizes ##
	
	If you have a working slideshow with images and change the size in the display
	settings, the current images won't be resized.
	You have to re-upload them so they are cropped according to the new settings.
